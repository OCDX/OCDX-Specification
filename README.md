# Open Community Data Exchange (OCDX)

## Summary

The OCDX community supports an open standard for describing data about online communities, as well as the support tools and workflow patterns for researchers and data providers to share their datasets with the wider community. The OCDX community aims to provide the lowest barriers to contributing/sharing data. We welcome your input, suggesting fields information for inclusion in the OCDX specification.
